Unfortunately, the initial excitement of the public was a little underwhelming
(yes, probably our marketing was underwhelming too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately (good news): As we want to keep McMinos
inspite of this alive and also want to open it up for academic and research projects,
we are open sourcing it. We will keep paied versions around to fund potential further
development of the game. If we get enough money, we will also still offer compiled versions
of the iOS versions. The sources of McMinos are hosted on https://github.com/ulno/mcminos.
It is availabel under the GPLv3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>/posts/mcminos-open-source/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 12:10:30 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>iOS Version Available</title><link>/posts/ios-version-available/</link><dc:creator>Andreas Neudecker &amp; Ulrich Norbisrath</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;There we go, McMinos is now also availabel in the Apple AppStore!

Let us use the comment section here to find and squish them.

&lt;p&gt;Some of you might have already found themselves on the page
and are hopefully waiting eagerly for our release.
I had some small setbacks, managing the two flavors of McMinos as well on
Android as on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news are: I did succeed tonight. Hopefully, I can start tomorrow to
upload the free and payed version to the respective stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep you updated.
Until next time&lt;/p&gt;
