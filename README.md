# McMinos is Alive...
... and now it's even open!

Let's keep it alive together.

McMinos is a Pacman-like puzzle game.

For more information, head to https://ulno.github.io/mcminos/

Just some quick info how to compile McMinos:

Initially you should have Java installed and for now a linux environment (cygwin might work).

After cloning McMinos from github, run tools/prepare_repo 
in a command line (you should only need to do this once).
This might take a while as it needs to compile all the images.

If everything went correctly, you should now be able to start McMinos by
executing tools/start or tools/start-fs (this latter tries to run McMinos
in fullscreen mode).

If errors occur, most usually there has been trouble with the image compilation,
try to run tools/images manually.

More to come, post issues, if you have trouble or fork and write help
writing/migrating documentation.
