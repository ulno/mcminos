=================================================

McMinos is a video game for mobile devices running either Android or iOS. We
created its ancestor in the early 1990ies for Atari ST computers. So you may
rightfully call it a retro game. We have now re-created it with the hope that
you will find joy and recreation playing it.

Unfortunately, the initial excitement of the public was a little underwhelming
(yes, probably our marketing was underwhelming too). As we want to keep McMinos
inspite of this alive and also want to open it up for academic and research projects,
we are open sourcing it. We tried to keep paid versions around,
but even that was more expensive than expected, so we are only having now
the open source option avaialble here on github.

The sources of McMinos are hosted on https://github.com/ulno/mcminos

If you want to support us, please try to compile your own version or help us to offer and make desktop and binaries for fdroid.

At first McMinos may look a lot like its archetype (Pacman and Sokoban), that classic video and
arcade game with a circular protagonist whose task it is to eat all pellets in
a maze. And indeed, some levels are just like that. But McMinos is more:
inspired by many classics we have added many extras and features to make our
levels fun, some rich in action, some brain teasers to puzzle you quite a
while.


Again, we hope to entertain you well with McMinos and look forward to your
opinions, requests, and ideas.

Have fun.
